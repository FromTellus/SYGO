# SYGO

Created during a hack day at Salt.

Simple functionality is there. A few pre-set locations for the user and the option to set their own location via longitude and latitude.

Features missing but might be implemented if it gets picked up again at a later time :


  //* Not in order of importance *//
  

  Saving a custom location.
  
  Getting user location automatically.
  
  Make information cards flippable. Make min/high temp one card, rain/radition the other.
  
  Use more parameters from the weather API (https://open-meteo.com/). For example : Clouds, snow, humidity, etc.
  
  Add multiple themes and change them depending on weather condition. Some friendly orange for sun, blue for rain, white/gray for clouds, etc.
  
  Tighten calibration of weather by using the hourly parameters instead of daily.
  
  Maybe let user set their own comfort parameters and respond accordingly?
  
  Set an actual link to the movie being recommended.
